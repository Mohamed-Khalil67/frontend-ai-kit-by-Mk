# CSS styling

## 1. Read before writing
- Find the project's styling system first: global stylesheet, SCSS variables or CSS custom properties, any utility framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap), and the component library in use.
- Reuse existing tokens (colors, spacing, radius, font families) and existing classes. Add a new token only when none fits, and put it where the others live.
- Check how component styles are scoped (Angular view encapsulation, Vue `scoped`, CSS modules). Global frameworks such as Bootstrap can collide with generic class names like `row` or `btn`, so use component-specific names.

## 2. Defaults to apply
- Layout: Grid for two-dimensional layout, Flexbox for one-dimensional. Use `gap`, not margins between siblings.
- Responsive: mobile first. Prefer container queries (`@container`) for components and media queries for page-level changes. Use `clamp()` for fluid type and spacing.
- Units: `rem` for type and spacing, `%`/`fr`/`dvh` for layout. Use `dvh`/`svh` instead of `vh` for full-height mobile layouts.
- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, `inset`) so RTL works without rewrites.
- Theming: custom properties on `:root`, overridden under a theme selector or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Use `color-scheme` and `light-dark()` where the browser support target allows.
- Modern selectors where support allows: `:has()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, native nesting, `@layer` for controlling cascade order. Check the project's browser support target before using anything newer.
- Avoid `!important`, fixed pixel heights on text containers and overly specific selectors. Fix cascade problems with `@layer` or lower specificity, not with more specificity.
- Do not use `z-index` without checking the stacking context; define z-index values as tokens.

## 3. Accessibility checks while styling
- Text contrast at least 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text and UI borders).
- Visible `:focus-visible` outline on every interactive element. Never remove outlines without a replacement.
- Touch targets at least 24x24 CSS px (44x44 preferred on touch UIs).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for anything that moves.

## 4. Verify
1. Read the project's commands from `package.json` (and its lockfile to pick npm, pnpm or yarn). Do not invent commands; if a check does not exist, say so.
2. Run the typecheck/build, the linter (stylelint if present) and the tests.
3. If a dev server and a browser tool are available, load the page and check 320px, 768px and 1280px widths, light and dark mode, and keyboard focus. Report what was checked and what was not.
