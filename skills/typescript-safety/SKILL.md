description: Keeps frontend TypeScript type-safe in Angular, React and Vue projects - strict compiler settings, no any, typed props/inputs/events/forms/stores, safe API data, and a typecheck gate before finishing. Use when the user says type safety, fix type errors, remove any, add types, strict mode, typed forms, typed props, or when writing or reviewing any TypeScript frontend code.

# TypeScript safety

## Rules (all frameworks)
- Respect the project's `tsconfig` strictness. Never loosen compiler options (`strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, Angular `strictTemplates`, Vue `vue-tsc`) to make an error go away. If tightening them is worthwhile, propose it separately.
- No `any` in new code. Use `unknown` and narrow it (type guards, `in`, `instanceof`, discriminated unions). Avoid `as` casts and `!` non-null assertions; when one is truly needed, add a one-line comment saying why it is safe.
- Data from outside the app (HTTP responses, `localStorage`, `postMessage`, URL params, JSON) is `unknown` until validated. A generic type parameter on an HTTP call is only a claim, not a check. Validate at the boundary with the project's existing validator (zod, valibot, a type guard) rather than adding a dependency; ask first if there is none and the data is risky.
- Model states with discriminated unions (`{ status: 'loading' } | { status: 'ok'; data: T } | ...`) instead of several optional fields. Make `switch` statements exhaustive with a `never` check.
- Export explicit types for public contracts (component inputs and outputs, store state, service methods). Let inference work for locals.
- Do not use `@ts-ignore`; use `@ts-expect-error` with a reason only as a last resort.

## Framework specifics
- **Angular:** keep `strictTemplates` on; use typed signal APIs (`input.required<T>()`, `output<T>()`, `model<T>()`), typed reactive forms (`FormControl<string>`, `NonNullableFormBuilder`) or Signal Forms where the project's version supports them, and typed route params and resolvers. Do not type `HttpClient` responses as `any`.
- **React:** type props with an interface or type alias, type event handlers and refs precisely, type context and reducer actions as unions, and type custom hook return values. Prefer inference over `React.FC` unless the project uses it.
- **Vue:** use `<script setup lang="ts">` with `defineProps<T>()`, `defineEmits<T>()`, typed `InjectionKey<T>` for provide/inject, typed Pinia stores and typed router meta. Run `vue-tsc`, which the Vue compiler alone does not replace.

## Verify
1. Find the typecheck command in `package.json` (`tsc --noEmit`, `ng build`, `vue-tsc --noEmit`, `typecheck`, or the project's build). Do not invent one; if none exists, run `npx tsc --noEmit -p <tsconfig>` and say so.
2. Run it, plus the linter and tests. A typecheck failure means the work is not done.
3. Report any `any`, cast or assertion you had to add, with the reason.
